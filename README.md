# CHEATSHEETS

When you start playing around with new tools and languages, it is better to have a cheatsheet with you! These are simple text documents that i wrote for myself if i forget a command or a key combination or whatever. Maybe it is useful on your way to learn something new.

You can use the cheatsheets with vim:

```
vim cheatsheetname
```
